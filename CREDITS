CONTRIBUTORS

(in order of appearance :)

William Ferrell (Choadstre) <willfe@yahoo.com>:
	- Project founder, wrote 1st version, much documentation, design
	  for V0.4, continued maintenance
It's Choadstre's fault that LCDproc exists. He wanted his computer to have
a heartbeat, like some HP workstations do. So he found a nice LCD, wrote
some amazingly spiffy software for it, and life was good.

Selene Scriven (ToyKeeper) <lcdproc@toykeeper.net>:
	- wrote V0.3 and most of V0.4, and helped procrastinate the rest
	  of the time...
ToyKeeper was the main programmer for LCDproc 0.2 - 0.4-pre9.  She took
Choadstre's idea and put it in its current form.
