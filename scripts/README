			systems without	the lsb-core package installed)

  - init-*.rpm		init-scripts for RPM based distributions that are
			not LSB 3.x conforming.

- a sub-directory debian/ that contains the infrastructure to create a
  Debian package for lcdproc.
  Simply copy the debian/ directory to the top-level source directory,
  adapt the call in debian/rules to your wishes, call
  	dpkg -rfakeoot -sd
  and you're done.
